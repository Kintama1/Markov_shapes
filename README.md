Describe how the system is personally meaningful to you (at least 1 paragraph).
Explain how working on it genuinely challenged you as a computer scientist (at least 1 paragraph).
How did you push yourself outside of your comfort zone?
Why was this an important challenge for you?
What are the next steps for you going forward?
Include a discussion of whether you believe your system is creative (and why or why not).
Make sure to credit your sources, including your colleagues if you sought their advice.

# Start:
How to run Markov shapes game:
In order to run it, you can run the shapes.py file on your local machine (make sure to have imported pygame I still did not make an exectubale file).
## The purpose of the game:
    The purpose of the game is to draw something, or construct something visually fun with the shapes that are generated
    There are 4 shapes that are generated after 5 seconds at the buttom of the screen and the player can move them around the screen to construct something
    The sequence of shapes is decided by a markov chain where each shape has an equal chance of being generated after each shape is generated

## How to play The game:
    To move the shape around you use the arrow base keys
    A to rotate shape to left and D to rotate shape to the right
    SpaceBar to place the current shape even if you still have time on the timer (skip to next shape)

    After shapes run out, q to exit or simply close the window(you can close the window at any time)




# How this system is meaningful to me:
This is my first serious attempt at building a game and what I believe to be my first satisfactory completion of a project, so this system is very meaningful to me. I also do believe that I built something that can be built on. More shapes that are better for visual construction can be easily added, the game can be made customizable (player chooses the shape, the number of shapes, the duration etc). There are a lot of things that I could add onto this if I wanted to which is very exciting. What is most important is I believe I can add those things if I take my time with them



# Help I got building this (my sources):

I first checked this youtube video by Tech with Tim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY&t=1420s

It was realy helpful so I checked up his repisotiry as a reference for the building blocks of the game:
his repo: https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Game-Dev-Intro

I also checked this video to draw different shapes (video by coding with Russ):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDP1Hk7uZFA

I checked this stack overflow to help with drawing text:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20842801/how-to-display-text-in-pygame

But most importantly I used a lot of CHATGPT to help me get going in the beginning, explain some concepts and debug certain things,
I also used Claude in the end to debug an issue as it is more powerful that CHATGPT
I did not ask the models to generate all the codes, but built my code, tested, fed it in for debugging, changed what they gave me back and ultimately built this

Special thanks to my roommates for testing it as well
